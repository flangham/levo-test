# Finn's Levo Test

**[View the site here](https://finnian-levo-test.netlify.app/)**.

I had a lot of fun with this. Given that this was my first time using TypeScript and Tailwind, it was definitely frustrating at times, but I learnt a lot which was very satisfying. Once I got the hang of the basics, I really enjoyed working with these technologies, and look forward to using them for future projects.

# Notes

- Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- There is a maximum character count for all the article preview text (200), in order to keep all the tiles roughly the same dimensions
- The site initially displays x number of articles, and the 'Load more' button adds the next x articles, where x is a contant integer
- Articles aren't reordered, just displayed in default order as returned from the API
- There is a max-width of all content at 1152px, centered
- Articles open in a new tab

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
