# Finn's Levo Test

[Here is a link](https://finnian-levo-test.netlify.app/) to the site hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I had a lot of fun with this. Given that this was my first time using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), it was definitely frustrating at times, but I learnt a lot which was very satisfying. Once I got the hang of the basics, I really enjoyed working with these technologies, and it's a no-brainer that I'll continue using them for future projects.

# Notes

- Built with React, Typescript and Tailwind
- There is a maximum character count for all the article preview text (200), in order to keep all the tiles roughly the same dimensions
- The site initially displays x number of articles, and the 'Load more' button adds the next x articles, where x is a contant integer
- There is a max-width of all content at 1152px, centered
- Articles open in a new tab

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
